# WAGON Food Donation Logging App
Made for logging the movement of food as part of the Worcester Academy Gives Others Nourishment (WAGON) program. 

Data from a Google Sheet containing Google Form responses is read into the app, processed, and displayed using Java AWT/Swing (not great I know) as well as written into a different Google Sheet.
